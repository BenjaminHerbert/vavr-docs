== Usage Guide

=== Core

Javaslang comes along with well designed representations of some of the most basic types which apparently are missing or rudimentary in Java: `Tuple`, `Value` and `λ`.

==== Tuple

Java is missing a general notion of tuples. A Tuple combines a fixed number of elements together so that they can be passed around as a whole. Unlike an array or list, a tuple can hold objects with different types, but they are also immutable.
Tuples are of type Tuple1, Tuple2, Tuple3 and so on. There currently is an upper limit of 8 elements. To access elements of a tuple `t`, you can use method `t._1` to access the first element, `t._2` to access the second, and so on.

===== Create a tuple
Here is an example of how to create a tuple holding a String and an Integer:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/javaslang/TupleDemo.java[tags=createTuple]
----
<1> A tuple is created via the static factory method `of()`
<2> Get the 1st element of this tuple.
<3> Get the 2nd element of this tuple.

===== Map a tuple

Map evaluates a function per element in the tuple, returning another tuple.

----

===== FlatMap a tuple

FlatMap is a frequently used combinator that combines mapping and flattening.

----

===== Transform a tuple

Transform creates a new type based on the tuple's contents.

include::../../test/java/javaslang/TupleDemo.java[tags=transformTuple]
----

==== Functions

Functional programming is all about values and transformation of values using functions. Java 8 just provides a `Function` which accepts one parameter and a `BiFunction` which accepts two parameters. Javaslang provides functions up to a limit of 8 parameters. The functional interfaces are of called `Function0, Function1, Function2, Function3` and so on. If you need a function which throws a checked exception you can use `CheckedFunction1, CheckedFunction2` and so on.
The following lambda expression creates a function to sum two integers:

include::../../test/java/javaslang/FunctionsDemo.java[tags=createFunctionWithLambda]
----

This is a shorthand for the following anonymous class definition:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/javaslang/FunctionsDemo.java[tags=createFunction]
----

You can also use the static factory method `Function3.of(...)` to a create a function from any method reference.

----

In fact Javaslang functional interfaces are Java 8 functional interfaces on steroids. They also provide features like:

* lifting
* currying
* memoization

===== Lifting
You can lift a partial function into a total function that returns an `Option` result. The term partial function comes from mathematics. A partial function from X to Y is a function f: X′ → Y, for some subset X′ of X. It generalizes the concept of a function f: X → Y by not forcing f to map every element of X to an element of Y. That means a partial function works properly only for some input values. If the function is called with a disallowed input values, it will typically throw an exception.

The following method `sum` is a partial function that only accepts positive Integers.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/javaslang/FunctionsDemo.java[tags=partialFunctionExample]
----

A lifted function returns `Some`, if the function is invoked with allowed input values.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/javaslang/FunctionsDemo.java[tags=liftPartialFunction1]
----

A lifted function returns `None` instead of throwing an exception, if the function is invoked with disallowed input values.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/javaslang/FunctionsDemo.java[tags=liftPartialFunction2]
----

===== Currying
Currying is a technique to partially apply a function by fixing values for some of the parameters. You can fix one or more parameters, depending on the number of parameters. The parameters are bound from left to right.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/javaslang/FunctionsDemo.java[tags=curryingFunction]
----

===== Memoization
Memoization is a form of caching. A memoized function executes only once and then returns the result from a cache.
The following example calculates a random number on the first invocation and returns the cached number on the second invocation.

==== Values

In a functional setting we see a value as a kind of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_form_(abstract_rewriting)[normal form], it cannot be further evaluated. In Java we express this by making the state of an object final and call it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object[immutable].

Javaslang's functional Value abstracts over immutable objects. Efficient write operations are added by sharing immutable memory between instances. What we get is thread-safety for free!

[source,java]
----
// future *value*, result of an async calculation
final Future<T> future = Future.of(...);

// lazy *value*, evaluated once
final Lazy<T> lazy = Lazy.of(...);

// optional *value*, no more nulls
final Option<T> option = Option.of(...);

// *value* of a possibly failing computation
final Try<T> tryy = Try.of(...);

// a list of *values*
final List<T> list = List.of(...);

// all of the above (here: value) obey:
final String s = value.filter(...).ifDefined("yay", "noes");

----

In Javaslang, all is built upon these three basic building blocks: tuples, functions and values. The possibilities are (countably) infinite...

=== Collections

With Javaslang there has been put much effort into designing an all-new collection library for Java which meets the requirements of functional programming, namely immutability.

Java's Stream lifts a computation to a different layer and links to a specific collection in another explicit step. Whith Javaslang we don't need all this additional boilerplate.

The new collections are based on http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html[java.lang.Iterable], so they leverage the sugared iteration style.

[source,java]
----
// 1000 random numbers
for (double random : Stream.gen(Math::random).take(1000)) {
    ...
}
----

`TraversableOnce` has a huge amount of useful functions to operate on the collection. Its API is similar to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html[java.util.stream.Stream] but more mature.

=== List

Javaslang's `List` is an immutable linked list. Mutations create new instances. Most operations are performed in linear time. Consequent operations are executed one by one.

==== Java 8

[source,java]
----
Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3).stream().reduce((i, j) -> i + j);

----

[source,java]
----
IntStream.of(1, 2, 3).sum();

----

==== Javaslang

[source,java]
----
// javaslang.collection.List
List.of(1, 2, 3).sum();

----

=== Stream

The `javaslang.collection.Stream` implementation is a lazy linked list. Values are computed only when needed. Because of its laziness, most operations are performed in constant time. Operations are intermediate in general and executed in a single pass.

The stunning thing about streams is that we can use them to represent sequences that are (theoretically) infinitely long.

[source,java]
----
// 2, 4, 6, ...
Stream.gen(1).filter(i -> i % 2 == 0);

----

=== Pattern Matching

Javaslang's pattern matching feature goes far beyond Java's switch.

[source,java]
----
Stream.of(0, 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, null, -1)
        .peek(n -> out.print(format("%d -> ", n)))
        .map(Match.as(Object.class) // Match function (with apply(Object))
                .when(Objects::isNull).then("!")
                .whenIs(0).then("zero")
                .whenIsIn(1, 13, 14).then(i -> "first digit 1: " + i)
                .whenType(Double.class).then(d -> "Found a double: " + d)
                .whenApplicable((Number num) -> "number: " + num).thenApply()
                .otherwise(() -> "no match"))
        .map(MatchingTest::toString)
        .forEach(out::println);
out.flush(); // Avoid mixing sout and serr

// Match monad (with map(), flatMap(), get(), orElse(), orElseGet(), orElseThrow(), etc.)
for (String s : Match.of(0)
        .whenType(Number.class).then(Object::toString)
        .otherwise("unknown")
        .map(String::toUpperCase)) {
    out.println(s);
}

----

Javaslang allows to match more special objects by more general cases:

[source,java]
----
// Match as Monad
Match.of(new Some<>(1))
     .whenApplicable((Option i) -> true).thenApply()
     .get(); // = true

Match.of(new Some<>(1))
     .whenType(Option.class).then(true)
     .get(); // = true

// Match as Function
Match.whenApplicable((Option i) -> true).thenApply()
     .apply(new Some<>(1)); // = true

Match.whenType(Option.class).then(true)
     .apply(new Some<>(1)); // = true

----

The opposite is also possible, to match more general objects by more special cases:

[source,java]
----
// Match as Monad
Match.of(Option.of(1))
     .whenIs(new Some<>(1)).then(true)
     .get(); // = true

// Match as Function
Match.whenIs(new Some<>(1)).then(true)
     .apply(Option.of(1)); // = true

----

=== Failure handling

The `Try` monad aims to ease exception handling. It represents the result state of a computation which may be a `Success` or a `Failure`.

==== Java 8

[source,java]
----
// cannot be final
A result = other;
try {
   result = bunchOfWork();
} catch(Exception_1 e) {
   ...
} catch(Exception_2 e) {
   ...
} catch(Exception_n e) {
   ...
}
----

==== Javaslang

[source,java]
----
// no need to handle exceptions
Try.of(() -> bunchOfWork()).orElse(other);

----

[source,java]
----
final A result = Try.of(this::bunchOfWork)
    .recover(x -> Match.of(x)
        .whenType(Exception_1.class).then(...)
        .whenType(Exception_2.class).then(...)
        .whenType(Exception_n.class).then(...)
        .get())
    .orElse(other);

----

Similar to collections it has the functions map() and flatMap() to further process results.

=== Property Checking

Property checking (also known as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_testing[property testing]) is a truly powerful way to test properties of our code in a functional way. It is based on __http://javaslang.com/#[arbitrarily]__ generated random data, which is passed to a user defined check function.

[source,java]
----
final Arbitrary ints = Arbitrary.integer();

// square(int) >= 0: OK, passed 1000 tests.
final CheckResult result = new Property("square(int) >= 0")
        .forAll(ints)
        .suchThat(i -> (i * i) >= 0)
        .check();
        .assertIsSatisfied();

----

Generators of complex data structures are composed of simple generators.
